15. Calculate the average salary for the players in the nba salary data table. 
Then, for every player with an average salary of 20 million or above, show their name, their average salary, and label them as a “high salary”.

SELECT player,
AVG(season17_18) AS average_salary
FROM nba_season1718_salary
GROUP BY player
)
SELECT player,
       average_salary,
       'High Salary' AS salary_identifier
FROM player_average_salary_cte
WHERE average_salary >= 20000000;
